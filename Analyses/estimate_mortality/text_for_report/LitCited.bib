This survey monitors relative abundance, annual mortality, and recruitment of oysters from commercially important beds and tracks relative changes in the overall stock. Studies have shown that the commercial dredge gear used for this and similar surveys does not collect live oysters, boxes, and cultch with equal efficiency. We compared catch rates of live oysters, boxes, and cultch using this gear to adjacent diver-collected samples. Dredge efficiency varied by bed with the lowest efficiency on the bed with the least fishing pressure, possibly due to a higher degree of reef consolidation. Dredge efficiencies between size classes (20–65mm, 65–75mm, >75mm) were highly variable, although the dredge may be biased towards the capture of live oysters and larger (>65mm) individuals. Oyster abundance (not including spat) estimated from annual surveys and corrected for dredge efficiency on the commercially important Delaware oyster beds increased from approximately 240 million to 491 million individuals between 2007 and 2008. A comparison of three estimation techniques (bed-specific efficiencies, mean efficiencies, and bootstrapping) is discussed in the broader context of estimating population abundance, size structure, recruitment, and mortality, when corrected and uncorrected for dredge efficiency.},

I describe integrated analysis and Bayesian analysis, which have been two of the most influential paradigms in fisheries stock assessment during the last two decades of the twentieth century. These two paradigms have generally been considered complementary, rather than competing. However, recent advances in integrated analysis, including the special case of meta-analysis, have made Bayesian analysis somewhat redundant. I describe how data used to create priors for use in Bayesian analysis can be integrated directly into the analyses. This provides a much more convenient way of accurately including the information and associated uncertainty into the analyses. I discuss how there is still a need to describe the uncertainty and suggest that research should focus on the most appropriate methods for doing this.},

As part of the monitoring effort, 27 discrete hatchery plantings spanning 10 y of restoration were sampled during late summer and fall 2009. Oyster shell height, dry meat weight, shell weight, and clump height all increased significantly with age. Perkinsus marinus infections were low in all sampled populations, but increased with ago. These data enable estimates of growth and shell production rates, and highlight the low prevalence of disease in restored Maryland oyster populations. The longevity of these dense patches suggests that local metapopulation restoration may provide substantial ecological services. The trends presented in this study may provide valuable insights for refining management tools, adapting ongoing restoration, and improving population modeling efforts.},

abstract={To evaluate methods for calculating mortality in bivalve molluscs, we analyzed historical data from dredge surveys of both planted and natural oyster (Crassostrea virginica) grounds in Delaware Bay to compare total box-count mortality estimates with those made by accumulating short-term mortality rates obtained from fresh boxes identified by shell condition and degree of fouling. Box-count and cumulative-mortality patterns and values agreed best on grounds with planted oysters, where a cohort with very few dead oysters was broadcast on previously cleaned bottom and was followed over time. This situation is analogous to an artificially created reef with oysters either deployed or naturally set on it. When deaths predominated in late summer and early autumn, the two estimates were similar throughout the following year; when mortality was greatest in spring or early summer, the estimates were similar only through autumn of the same year. Correspondence was much weaker on natural beds, where new individuals constantly recruited to the population and variable numbers of boxes were always present. Nevertheless, total box-count mortality estimates made during autumn stock surveys were significantly correlated with cumulative mortalities calculated for the preceding year. We also estimated disarticulation rates of artificially created boxes by deploying them at three seasons and eight sites in Delaware Bay. Disarticulation time depended on the length of exposure at summer temperatures, with the average time to 50{\%} disarticulation for boxes deployed in spring and in summer being 225 and 345 days, respectively. Disarticulation rates increased with decreasing size, and increasing salinity and temperature. Finally, we compared total box-count and cumulative-mortality estimates with those made using the disarticulation data. Annual averages for the three methods were within 5 percentage points of each other. Our data indicate that total box-count mortality estimates from fall stock surveys can provide a reliable index to total mortality for the previous year, although it cannot describe the seasonal patterns obtainable using the cumulative-mortality method. *** DIRECT SUPPORT *** A02BY003 00003",

abstract = {Eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica in Chesapeake Bay, USA, have been subjected to intense harvest pressure since about 1850 and to disease epizootics since the 1950s. Combined, these processes have degraded the once extensive eastern oyster bottom; the remaining oyster shells, which are required as substrate for successful larval oyster settlement, are thus rendered increasingly susceptible to siltation. Between 1999 and 2001, we used an acoustic seabed classification system and underwater videography to assess oyster habitat conditions throughout Maryland's portion of Chesapeake Bay relative to eastern oyster recruitment and habitat restoration activities. We performed 16 surveys that covered a total of 39 km2 of bottom that were classified in 1911 as supporting productive oyster populations. Over 90\% of this area has degraded from productive oyster bottom to mud, sand, or heavily sedimented oyster shell. Seventy percent of the locations we identified as containing unsedimented shell came from within the approximately 90 km2 of oyster bottom that had been subject to the management activity of spreading large volumes of shell at some time between 1960 and 1999. However, video observations of 49 of these locations that had been replenished with shell at various times indicated that any improvements in oyster habitat were short lived, as interstitial spaces in spread shell became highly sedimented after an average period of 5.5 years (n = 49; SE = 1.03). We conclude that the majority of oyster bottom in Maryland is extremely degraded and that no reasonable increase in the scale of present management practices will reverse this habitat decline.},

abstract = { Catchability is an important parameter in many stock assessment models because it relates an index of abundance to stock size. We review the theory and evidence for time-varying catchability, its effects on stock assessment estimates, and methods to include time-varying catchability in stock assessments. Numerous studies provide strong evidence that time-varying catchability is common in most fisheries and many fishery-independent surveys and can be caused by anthropogenic, environmental, biological, and management processes. Trends in catchability over time can cause biased estimates of stock size and fishing mortality rates in stock assessment models that do not compensate for them. Methods that use descriptive and functional relationships have been developed to incorporate time-varying catchability in stock assessment models. We recommend that the default assumption for stock assessments should be that catchability varies over time and that multiple methods of including time-varying catchability should be applied. Additional studies are needed to determine relative performance of alternative methods and to develop methods for selecting among models. },

The CRC is also host to some of the largest oyster restoration projects in the world. Yet the relative effects of harvest and restoration on the population dynamics of eastern oyster in the CRC have not been assessed. We developed stage-based population models for each region of the CRC in AD Model Builder using dredge survey and harvest data provided by Maryland Department of Natural Resources from 1989 to 2015. Patterns in exploitation rates over time varied among regions. Abundance generally decreased during 1989–2003 and increased thereafter. Recruitment was greatest in the late 1990s, 2010, and 2012, which led to increases in abundance. Natural mortality was low across all regions during 2004-2015. Habitat, recruitment, and abundance declined 50–70% during 1989–2015, but fishery effort increased in years with higher abundance.}

abstract = {A reliable measure of gear capture efficiency is required to calculate unbiased estimates of population size and fishing mortality from survey data in a stock assessment. However, capture efficiency can vary spatially and temporally due to changes in abundance, stock area, the environment, and the sampling gear itself. Therefore, periodic reassessment of this parameter is necessary to ensure that the catchability coefficients being applied accurately reflect the capture efficiency of the survey sampling gear, especially when catchability is being estimated outside of the stock assessment model. Using data from field experiments conducted in 1999, 2000, 2003, and 2013, we evaluated spatial and temporal variability in capture efficiency for a commercial dredge used to conduct a fishery-independent survey of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) population in Delaware Bay, USA. A spatial gradient in capture efficiency was detected, but no temporal trend. Capture efficiency was a function of the density of oysters in the sampled area. To our knowledge this is the first time density-dependent capture efficiency has been identified for a sessile invertebrate stock survey. Since density dependence in capture efficiency leads to hyperstable catch-per-unit-effort, caution is advised when deriving oyster abundance from dredge survey catch-per-effort data, especially at low oyster density and when high spatial resolution estimates of survey dredge capture efficiency are not available.},

All larvae taken in the river were collected near the bottom at or just after low tide, while most of those caught in tidal creeks were near the surface, but also were caught near the time of low tide. A possible explanation for this difference is the development of air-breathing in the shrinking larvae. Larvae appear to be more active at night and may thereby avoid high daytime predation.},
