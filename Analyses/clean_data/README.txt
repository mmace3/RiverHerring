clean_data_old is a file with the clean data I was using for the Z estimates before I got
updated from Wes for NY and I switched to using the Maine data that Kaite compiled. The
Maine data Katie compiled has the specific rivers listed and not grouped together. The
updated NY data from Wes has some additional data from recent years.
